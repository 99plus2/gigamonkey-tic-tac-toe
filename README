Three versions of a simple tic-tac-toe game.

perfect.py is based on the idea of Ken Thompson's perfect chess
endgame player. Code golfed as far as I could without totally
obfuscating it to get it under 100 lines.

search.py is a completely brute force search.

alphabeta.py Also implements a search but uses alpha-beta pruning to
do less work.
